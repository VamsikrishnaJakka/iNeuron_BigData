I do office work as a test engineer and then prepare for a data engineering role. Most of my stress is to balance both. 
Sometimes I am tired of office work, I don't understand a few topics in the course, office deadlines, course deadlines, and peers get more appreciation than me 
even though I worked more than them and gave better results, I'm still stuck in the position whereas others were moving forward.

Here's a schematic stress management plan I started to do:

1. **Prioritize and Plan:**
   - Evaluate your tasks and prioritize them based on urgency and importance.
   - Create a schedule that allows for dedicated time for both office work and data engineering preparation.
   - Break down complex topics into smaller, manageable chunks for easier understanding.

2. **Effective Time Management:**
   - Use time management techniques such as the Pomodoro Technique (working in focused intervals with breaks) to enhance productivity and reduce fatigue.
   - Set realistic deadlines for your tasks and allocate specific time slots for each activity.
   - Avoid multitasking and focus on one task at a time to improve efficiency.

3. **Self-Care and Relaxation:**
   - Prioritize self-care activities such as exercise, relaxation techniques, and hobbies to recharge and reduce stress.
   - Take regular breaks during the day to rest and rejuvenate.
   - Practice deep breathing exercises or meditation during stressful moments to calm your mind.

4. **Seek Support and Communication:**
   - Reach out to your colleagues, mentors, or a support network to discuss your challenges and seek guidance.
   - Communicate with your supervisor or manager about your workload and any difficulties you are facing.
   - Engage in open and honest conversations with peers about your concerns and accomplishments.

5. **Set Realistic Expectations:**
   - Be realistic about what you can achieve within a given timeframe.
   - Set attainable goals and celebrate small victories along the way to maintain motivation.
   - Avoid comparing yourself to others and focus on your own progress and growth.

6. **Continuous Learning and Skill Development:**
   - Embrace a growth mindset and view challenges as opportunities for learning.
   - Seek resources and support to better understand challenging topics in your data engineering course.
   - Break down complex concepts into smaller parts and seek clarification through online resources, forums, or reaching out to instructors.

7. **Celebrate Achievements and Practice Gratitude:**
   - Acknowledge and celebrate your achievements, no matter how small they may seem.
   - Practice gratitude by focusing on the positive aspects of your work and personal life.
   - Keep a gratitude journal to reflect on the things you appreciate and the progress you've made.

8. **Seek Balance and Set Boundaries:**
   - Establish clear boundaries between work and personal life to avoid burnout.
   - Communicate your needs and limitations to your supervisor and colleagues.
   - Learn to say "no" when necessary to manage your workload effectively.
